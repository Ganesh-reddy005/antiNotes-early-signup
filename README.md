# Antinotes v1.0 // Public Beta

**Logic, not syntax. Thinking, not typing.**

Antinotes is an AI-native engineering platform designed to break the "Tutorial Hell" loop. We don't check if your code *runs* (Test Cases); we check *how you think* (Engineering Standards).

Using a **Socratic Multi-Agent Engine**, we force users to derive solutions from first principles rather than memorizing syntax.
